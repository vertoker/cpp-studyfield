If I think in borders of book, it will be `linked list`

But my real job experience say to me - it's `array`

Enough preallocated array will be work faster than any list. Yes, in that case will appear operation limit,
but compact memory chunk will be more profitable than any list.
Farewell, why don't use both. Like for every day use `array` and for everything use `linked list`
